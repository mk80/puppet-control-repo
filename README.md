# Puppet Control Repository


## What You Get From This control-repo

Borrowed from: https://github.com/puppetlabs/control-repo

i am using this repo to test ci/cd with puppet and r10k and this is the control repo.
there will be basic and hopefully some advanced mods with some config to test deployment and functionality.




The important files and items in this template are as follows:

* Basic example of roles and profiles.
* An example Puppetfile with various module references.
* An example Hiera configuration file and data directory with pre-created common.yaml and nodes directory.
  * These match the default hierarchy that ships with PE.
* An [environment.conf](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/config_file_environment.html) that correctly implements:
  * A site-modules directory for roles, profiles, and any custom modules for your organization.
  * A config\_version script.
* An example [config\_version](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/config_file_environment.html#environment-conf-allowed-settings) script that outputs the git commit ID of the code that was used during a Puppet run.

Here's a visual representation of the structure of this repository:
